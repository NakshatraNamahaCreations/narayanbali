              <p className={styles.subText}>
              Pitru​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ Dosha is a condition that arises when the ancestors are not comfortable due to lack of proper rites, deaths that happened abruptly, or shraddha karma that was missed. Pitru Dosha Pooja in Srirangapatna is the way to do the poojas that the soul needs for freedom. The ancestors are given food and help through the offerings, mantras, and pindas.
             </p>
             <p className={styles.subText}>
             The Pitru Dosha Pooja in Srirangapatna is mainly done to get rid of the ancestral disturbances that block the flow of good health, marriage, finances, and emotional stability. This is one of the strongest antidotes for a family's welfare to be back ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌again.
